# SILO Website, UQ Design Studio 2017

A web visualisation prototype of climate data from the Department of Science, Innovation and Information Technology

The SILO (Scientific Information for Land Owners) database consists of historical climate records for Australia and contains daily climate data from 1889 to the present. Currently, data is displayed in text format and must be downloaded for analysis and no visualisation tools are provided. This consists of the user completing an online form and having the raw data emailed to them, which they then must analyse and create visualisations for themselves. For the casual or new user this is time consuming and requires extra technical knowledge that some users do not have.

The SILO web interface will display the datasets as a graph, with the inputs of start and end dates as well as from which station they wish to obtain their data from. The user can specify what kind of data they want to see - the minimum, maximum, or average temperature or rainfall or humidity and etc. Then those values will be displayed as a graph from which the user can download it either in CSV format or as an image.
